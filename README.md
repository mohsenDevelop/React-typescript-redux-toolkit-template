### Component Structure

- Keep components focused and single-responsibility. Each component should do one thing and do it well.
- Use meaningful file and folder names for components.
- Separate presentation (UI) components from container (logic) components when possible.
- Follow a consistent component directory structure (e.g., `FooBar/index.ts`):
  1. `index.ts`
  2. `FooBar.tsx`
  3. `FooBar.types.ts`
  4. `FooBar.styled.ts`
  5. `FooBar.utils.ts`

  ### Submitting Pull Requests

- Choose the right title for your merge request:
   1. `type/message` (e.g. feat/commit message)
      1. `type`: hotfix, fix, feat, style
8. Assign appropriate label to your merge request
